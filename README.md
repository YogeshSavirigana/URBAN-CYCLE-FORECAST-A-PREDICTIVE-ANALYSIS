BikeForecast represents a pioneering effort to revolutionize urban mobility by harnessing the power of predictive analytics. The project draws its data from the dynamic landscape of the Seoul Bike Sharing System, where the number of public bikes hired at each hour is intricately linked with various contextual factors such as temperature and functioning hours. As many modern cities are increasingly embracing bike-sharing initiatives to improve convenience and sustainability, the challenge lies in efficiently managing the supply of rental bikes to meet the fluctuating demands of the public.

The dataset, meticulously curated from http://data.seoul.go.kr/, provides a rich source of information that forms the backbone of the predictive model. By employing advanced machine learning algorithms in R, BikeForecast aims to forecast the hourly demand for rental bikes, offering a glimpse into the future requirements of the Seoul Bike Sharing System. The inclusion of temperature as a variable recognizes its impact on user behavior, considering how weather conditions can influence the decision to opt for a bike ride.

At its core, BikeForecast addresses the crucial need for cities to anticipate and prepare for the ebb and flow of bike-sharing demand. By accurately predicting the volume of bikes required at each hour, the project not only seeks to minimize waiting times for users but also provides city authorities with invaluable insights for the strategic management of the rental bike fleet. This proactive approach to resource allocation is poised to redefine the efficiency and reliability of urban transportation systems, setting the stage for a more seamless and sustainable urban future.
